    "\n",
    "  Machine learning is a quite popular topic recent days. With more advanced algorithms being created and higher computing ability, we can train the machine learning model based on history data to predict feature with high accuracy. This kind of predictive model can be applied into diverse domains such as bio-informatics, economy, electrical engineering so as to optimize industrial products or help to make decisions.  \n",

Once this model gets applied, the NYC taxi drivers can know how long the customers would take the taxi in advance with several features get detected.   \n",

    "<img style=\"width:60%\" src=\"images/15.jpg\" /> \n",
    "In cluster analysis, the Mini Batch KMeans algorithm can be used to partition the input data set into k partitions.   \n",
    "The Mini Batch KMeans contains 2 steps:\n",
    "> 1. Data assigment step:  \n",
    "Each centroid defines one of the clusters. In this step, each data point is assigned to its nearest centroid, based on the squared Euclidean distance. \n",
    "> 2. Centroid update step:  \n",
    "In this step, the centroids are recomputed. This is done by taking the mean of all data points assigned to that centroid's cluster.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Haversine Distance  \n",
    "Also, with dropoff longitude, dropoff latitude, pickup longitude, pickup latitude features, I computed haversine distance. The formula can be seen below.\n",
    "<img style=\"width:60%\" src=\"images/16.jpg\" />   \n",
    "\n",
    "3. XGBoost  \n",
    "The predictive regression algorithm that train the feature data so as to predict trip duration is XGBoost.\n",
    "XGBoost is an open-source software library which provides the gradient boosting framework for C++, Java, Python, R, and Julia. It works on Linux, Windows, and macOS. From the project description, it aims to provide a \"Scalable, Portable and Distributed Gradient Boosting (GBM, GBRT, GBDT) Library\".\n",
    "XGBoost is short for **Extreme Gradient Boosting**, where the term “Gradient Boosting” is proposed in the paper Greedy Function Approximation: A Gradient Boosting Machine, by Friedman. XGBoost is based on this original model. This is a tutorial on gradient boosted trees, and most of the content is based on these slides by the author of xgboost.    \n",
    ">**Gradient boosting** is a machine learning technique for regression and classification problems, which produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision trees. It builds the model in a stage-wise fashion like other boosting methods do, and it generalizes them by allowing optimization of an arbitrary differentiable loss function.  \n",
    "In GBDT the trees are mostly trained sequentially so that each subsequent tree trains on examples that are poorly labelled by the previously fitted trees.    \n",
    "\n",
    ">There are three key advantages of GBDTs:\n",
    ">1. Better results with smaller data: DNNs work well for large datasets, but they are so overparametrized compared to GBDTs that GBDTs are likely to outperform DNNs in the 100–10,000 range of training instances.  \n",
    ">2. Minimal fine tuning: GBDTs can be blindly pointed at a problem and you can expect sane results.  \n",
    ">3. Super fast training: Training a GBDT can be done very rapidly; usually seconds or minutes, hours at most."

    ">+ In this project, the relationship between trip duration and other features cannot be linear. So this model will be underfitting and the loss will be a little bit high.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. K Neighbors Regressor with n_neighbors=5\n",
    ">+ k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) is a non-parametric method used for classification and regression. In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in the feature space. The output depends on whether k-NN is used for classification or regression:\n",
    ">+ In k-NN regression, the output is the property value for the object. This value is the average of the values of its k nearest neighbors.    \n",
    ">+ k-NN is a type of instance-based learning, or lazy learning, where the function is only approximated locally and all computation is deferred until classification. The k-NN algorithm is among the simplest of all machine learning algorithms.\n",
    ">+ In this project, KNN will also be underfitting due to the simplicity of model. The result will have high bias, so the loss will be a little bit high. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Random Forest Regressor with n_estimators=100  \n",
    ">+ Random forests or random decision forests are an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks, that operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.   \n",
    ">+ Random decision forests correct for decision trees' habit of overfitting to their training set.  \n",
    ">+ The training algorithm for random forests applies the general technique of bootstrap aggregating, or bagging, to tree learners. Recall that the key to bagging is that trees are repeatedly fit to bootstrapped subsets of the observations. One can show that on average, each bagged tree makes use of around two-thirds of the observations.\n",
    ">+ But when building these decision trees,each time a split in a tree is considered, a random sample of m predictors is chosen as split candidates from the full set of p predictors. Using a small value of m in building a random forest will typically be helpful when we have a large number of correlated predictors.    \n",
    ">+ This bootstrapping procedure leads to better model performance because it decreases the variance of the model, without increasing the bias ."
